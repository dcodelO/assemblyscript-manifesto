# assemblyscript-manifesto

Hi @dcode please unblock me I want to make assemblyscript better! honest!

I was the big league programmer at work and I had to use this goofy programming language called "AssemblyScript". I must tell you, there were a million bugs, believe me! Everybody was talking about it. So every time I tried to use it, I kept finding more and more bugs, that I can tell you. I was so frustrated! Okay?

By the way, I tried to file a bug report in the issue tracker so that the people who made AssemblyScript could fix the bugs. But when I filed the bug report, everyone thought I was trolling! They don't respect us. They didnt believe that there were so many bugs in AssemblyScript. They don't have a clue.

Like this one time, I was trying to do a ternary, but it kept mistaking the colon for an arrow function, like it was never seen before, ever! I couldnt do anything!

```ts
a ? (b) : c
```

Parser error! Believe me!

I kept filing bug reports, one after the other. Filing, filing, filing. I couldnt believe it! Every time I found a bug, I would file a report, but nobody would believe me. They don't believe us, they don't! They triaged my bug reports but kept telling me that I was just trying to cause trouble. Crooked devs!

I couldn't do an arrow function!! it wouldn't work!! 

```ts
let y: ((x: i32) => i32);
```

they're laughing at us.  They're rolling in their graves!

I was trying to do my job!it seemed like AssemblyScript was determined to make my life a living nightmare. it really did. they don't fix them. Not gonna happen. That's just what I had heard.

```ts
{ x: 1 };
```

by the way, it doesn't work !! they're getting away with murder!

I made a fourth bug report, and I was just so disappointed. believe me. I couldn't bring myself to put anything in that issue description. THey weren't gonna fix it. They weren't. I must tell you, my pay was gonna be docked, right? Garnished!

the next morning, assemblyscript was working fine, and that was really suprising, that I can tell you. and then I hit compile. all of sudden, the compiler was leaking ram and using 100% CPU! 100%! and then it BSOD!

I was furious, by tge way. After I filed the next bug report, they had had enough. They deleted all of my bug reports and blocked me from the repository. Blocked! I was so disappointed! I couldnt believe that nobody believed me when I was just trying to help make AssemblyScript better.

I mean, talk about adding insult to injury! I was just trying to do my job, but it seemed like AssemblyScript was determined to make my life a living nightmare! And to top it all off, those developers reposted my bugs and said I was trolling them!! It was like they were saying "Thanks, but no thanks."

I want to report more bugs, so unblock me please dcode
